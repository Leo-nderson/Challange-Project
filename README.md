### What I learned

I am very proud of my first project challange although it was really challanging because i got stuck at a point where i had to  add color to the dots and numbers (".") on both ordered (ol) and unordered (ul)list, i was just staring at the screen of my laptop for more than 30 minutes  at the end i was able to figure it out.
```css
li::marker{
    color: hsl(14, 45%, 36%);
}

### Continued development

I still need a lot of practics on responsiveness on different screen sizes.
